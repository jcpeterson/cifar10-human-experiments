--- POST ICLR reviews ---

For the ICLR draft, we realized wide resnet (wrn) with cutout was just another run of
wrn without cutout, so we decided to just not include the cutout version since it 
we don't do more than one model for other architecture types anyway. We did decide to
put resnext back in since we reran the training for all models and it should now be
performing find (didn't check yet)
